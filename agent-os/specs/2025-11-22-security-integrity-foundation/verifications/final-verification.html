# Verification Report: Security & Integrity Foundation

**Spec:** `2025-11-22-security-integrity-foundation`
**Date:** 2025-11-22
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

## Executive Summary

The Security & Integrity Foundation has been successfully implemented and verified. The API is now protected by a Global
Exception Filter that masks sensitive errors, Rate Limiting to prevent abuse, and an API Key Guard for internal routes.
The Frontend has a Global Error Boundary to handle runtime crashes gracefully. All feature-specific tests are passing.
