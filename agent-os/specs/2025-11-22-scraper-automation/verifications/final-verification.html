# Verification Report: Scraper Automation

**Spec:** `2025-11-22-scraper-automation`
**Date:** 2025-11-22
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed

---

## Executive Summary

The Scraper Automation feature has been successfully implemented and verified. The backend now utilizes BullMQ for
robust job processing with retries and exponential backoff, and NestJS Schedule for daily cron execution at 3 AM. Tests
confirm that the scheduler correctly triggers jobs and the processor executes the scraping logic as expected.
