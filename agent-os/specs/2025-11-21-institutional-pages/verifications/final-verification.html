## Executive Summary

The "Institutional Pages" feature has been successfully implemented. The `/sobre` page provides static content about the
project's mission, and the `/estados` page dynamically lists all Brazilian states with their respective event counts,
powered by a new backend aggregation endpoint. E2E tests verify the rendering and navigation of these pages, including
mobile responsiveness.
