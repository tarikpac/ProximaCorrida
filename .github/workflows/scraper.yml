# ⚠️  DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
# =====================================================
# This workflow is DISABLED. It was replaced by:
#   - scraper-standalone.yml (runs Playwright scraper directly)
#
# The old approach called /scraper/cron-trigger on Render.
# Now the scraper runs as a standalone script on GitHub Actions,
# writing directly to Supabase.
#
# Date deprecated: 2025-12-08
